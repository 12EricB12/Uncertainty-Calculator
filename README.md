# Uncertainty Calculator

Hey there! You've reached the depths of optimizing PHYS 131 labs. This is a very simple uncertainty calculator, meant for saving you those 5 extra seconds you need to hand in your lab report before the submission closes.

If you want the direct download link, here it is:

Otherwise, you can sort through the source code if you're feeling like it. If you find an issue or want to make a suggestion, please do so under the issues tab.
Remember: I am a uni student. So updates will come as I please. This is also half spaghetti code, so don't expect any production level code.

Anyways, have fun with it and good luck on your future labs!
