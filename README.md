# Uncertainty Calculator

Hey there! You've reached the depths of optimizing PHYS labs. This is a very simple uncertainty calculator, meant for saving you those 5 extra seconds you need to hand in your lab report before the submission closes.

Otherwise, you can sort through the source code if you're feeling like it. 

# Features

Multiplication/division uncertainty  
Power uncertainty  
The mental state of any PHYS 131 student as the app icon

# Find a bug?
If you find an issue or want to make a suggestion, please do so under the **issues** tab.

**Remember**: I am a uni student. So updates/fixes will come when I don't have 20 different assignments due on Friday. I apologize for any wait in advance!  
This is also half spaghetti code, so don't expect any production level code. Its literally just a couple of text boxes.

Anyways, have fun with it and good luck on your future labs!

# OS Requirements
Windows only for now  
.NET Framework (8.0) if you're planning on doing anything with the code
